  abstract   = {In this paper, we address the issues of whether reductions in fertility increase human capital investments per child and whether twinning can identify the quantity—quality (Q-Q) trade-off. We show that estimates of the effects of twinning at higher parities on the outcomes of older children in prior studies do not identify family-size effects but are confounded by inter-child allocation effects because of the endowment deficit and close spacing of twins. However, examining the effects of twinning by birth order, net of the effects stemming from the endowment deficit of twins, can provide upper and lower bounds on the trade-off between the family size and average child quality. Our estimates, based on data from China, indicate that an extra child at parity one or at parity two, net of one component of birth-endowment effects associated with birth weight, significantly decreases the schooling progress, the expected college enrolment, grades in school and the assessed health of all children in the family. Despite the evident significant trade-off between number of children and child quality in China, the findings suggest that the contribution of the one-child policy in China to the development of its human capital was modest.},

The currently accepted solution to this problem is to use instrumental variables (IVs), for example, based on twin births. In this paper, I review and add to the critique of IVs based on twin births and show that that there are so many issues—major and minor—with these IVs that results based on them are not reliable or interpretable. I also review other IVs used in the literature, for example IVs based on the sexes of the firstborn children, and conclude that there are, as of yet, no credible IVs for the number of children. We need to disregard results from studies applying these IVs, reevaluate the current state of knowledge, and develop new, more credible methods.},

A larger family generated by twins in a later birth reduces the likelihood that older children attend private school, reduces the mother's labor force participation, and increases the likelihood that parents divorce. The impact of family size on a measure of child outcome, such as grade retention, is less clear. The results indicate that for both measures of child investment and child well-being, the 2SLS estimates are statistically distinguishable from OLS estimates, indicating an omitted variables bias in the single equation model.},

To address the problems associated with comparing subjects by the ignorable assignment-an "intention-to-treat analysis"-we make use of instrumental variables, which have long been used by economists in the context of regression models with constant treatment effects. We show that the instrumental variables (IV) estimand can be embedded within the Rubin Causal Model (RCM) and that under some simple and easily interpretable assumptions, the IV estimand is the average causal effect for a subgroup of units, the compliers. Without these assumptions, the IV estimand is simply the ratio of intention-to-treat causal estimands with no interpretation as an average causal effect. The advantages of embedding the IV approach in the RCM are that it clarifies the nature of critical assumptions needed for a causal interpretation, and moreover allows us to consider sensitivity of the results to deviations from key assumptions in a straightforward manner. We apply our analysis to estimate the effect of veteran status in the Vietnam era on mortality, using the lottery number that assigned priority for the draft as an instrument, and we use our results to investigate the sensitivity of the conclusions to critical assumptions.},

It is estimated that more than 180 million couples in developing countries suffer from primary or secondary infertility. In most African countries, the social stigma of childlessness still leads to isolation and abandonment. Differences between the developed and developing world are emerging because of the different availability in infertility care and the different socio-cultural value surrounding procreation and childlessness., Although reproductive health education and prevention of infertility are number one priorities, the need for accessible diagnostic procedures and affordable assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is very high. The success and sustainability of ART in resource-poor settings will depend, to a large extend, on our ability to optimise these techniques in terms of availability, affordability and effectiveness., Different new innovations and techniques can make the diagnostic work-up and treatment through assisted reproductive technologies (ART), including in-vitro fertilization (IVF), more affordable. These include automated smartphone-based assays for semen analysis and simplified IVF culture systems. The initiative of African Network and Registry for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ANARA) to register all IVF cycles in Africa needs our support and will be of paramount importance in the future., The hurdles to implement ART in most African countries are numerous and although more and more IVF centres are founded, the accessibility to ART remains very low.},

Instrumental variables ({IV}) estimates using sex composition as an instrument show no significant negative effect of family size; however, {IV} estimates using twins imply that family size has a negative effect on {IQ} scores. Our results suggest that the effect of family size depends on the type of family-size intervention and that there are no important negative effects of expected increases in family size. However, unexpected shocks to family size resulting from twin births have negative effects on the {IQ} scores of existing children.},

  abstract     = {What is the evidence pertaining to availability, effectiveness and safety of {ART} in sub-Saharan Africa?According to overall limited and heterogeneous evidence, availability and utilization of {ART} are very low, clinical pregnancy rates largely compare to other regions but are accompanied by high multiple pregnancy rates, and in the near absence of data on deliveries and live births the true degree of effectiveness and safety remains to be established.In most world regions, availability, utilization and outcomes of {ART} are monitored and reported by national and regional {ART} registries. In sub-Saharan Africa there is only one national and no regional registry to date, raising the question what other evidence exists documenting the status of {ART} in this region.A systematic review was conducted searching Pubmed, Scopus, Africawide, Web Of Science and {CINAHL} databases from January 2000 to June 2017. A total of 29 studies were included in the review. The extracted data were not suitable for meta-analysis.The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews ({PRISMA}) guidelines. All peer-reviewed manuscripts irrespective of language or study design that presented original data pertaining to availability, effectiveness and safety of {ART} in sub-Saharan Africa were eligible for inclusion. Selection criteria were specified prior to the search. Two authors independently reviewed studies for possible inclusion and critically appraised selected manuscripts. Data were analysed descriptively, being unsuitable for statistical analysis.The search yielded 810 references of which 29 were included based on the predefined selection and eligibility criteria. Extracted data came from 23 single centre observational studies, two global {ART} reports, two reviews, one national data registry and one community-based study. {ART} services were available in 10 countries and delivered by 80 centres in six of these. Data pertaining to number of procedures existed from three countries totalling 4619 fresh non-donor aspirations in 2010. The most prominent barrier to access was cost. Clinical pregnancy rates ranged between 21.2\% and 43.9\% per embryo transfer but information on deliveries and live births were lacking, seriously limiting evaluation of {ART} effectiveness. When documented, the rate of multiple pregnancy was high with information on outcomes similarly lacking.The findings in this review are based on limited data from a limited number of countries, and are derived from heterogeneous studies, both in terms of study design and quality, many of which include small sample sizes. Although representing best available evidence, this requires careful interpretation regarding the degree of representativeness of the current status of {ART} in sub-Saharan Africa.The true extent and outcome of {ART} in sub-Saharan Africa could not be reliably documented as the relevant information was not available. Current efforts are underway to establish a regional {ART} data registry in order to report and monitor availability, effectiveness and safety of {ART} thus contributing to evidence-based practice and possible development strategies.No funding was received for this study.

We show here that {TSLS} can also be used to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments such as drug dosage, hours of exam preparation, cigarette smoking, and years of schooling. The average causal effect in which we are interested is a conditional expectation of the difference between the outcomes of the treated and what these outcomes would have been in the absence of treatment. Given mild regularity assumptions, the probability limit of {TSLS} is a weighted average of per-unit average causal effects along the length of an appropriately defined causal response function. The weighting function is illustrated in an empirical example based on the relationship between schooling and earnings.},

The sex ratio of the first two siblings is arguably randomly assigned and influences the probability of having a third child, which makes it a candidate instrument for fertility when estimating the effect of fertility on female labor supply. However, identification hinges on the random assignment of the instrument, an instrumental exclusion restriction, and the monotonicity of fertility in the instrument. We find that the instrumental variable tests of Kitagawa and Huber and Mellace do not point to a violation of these assumptions in the Angrist and Evans data (which can, however, not be ruled out even asymptotically as the tests cannot detect all possible violations).},

@Report{Angrist2006,
  abstract = {A longstanding question in the economics of the family is the relationship between sibship size and subsequent human capital formation and economic welfare. If there is a \%u201Cquantity-quality trade-off,\%u201D then policies that discourage large families should lead to increased human capital, higher earnings, and, at the macro level, promote economic development. Ordinary least squares regression estimates and a large theoretical literature suggest that this is indeed the case. This paper provides new evidence on the child-quantity/child-quality trade-off. Our empirical strategy exploits exogenous variation in family size due to twin births and preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition, as well as ethnic differences in the effects of these variables, and preferences for boys in some ethnic groups. We use these sources of variation to look at the causal effect of family size on completed educational attainment, fertility, and earnings. For the purposes of this analysis, we constructed a unique matched data set linking Israeli Census data with information on the demographic structure of families drawn from a population registry. Our results show no evidence of a quantity-quality trade-off, though some estimates suggest that first-born girls from large families marry sooner.},

However, there is little causal evidence that speaks to this theory. Using a rich data set on the entire population of Norway over an extended period of time, we examine the effects of family size and birth order on the educational attainment of children. We find a negative correlation between family size and children's education, but when we include indicators for birth order or use twin births as an instrument, family size effects become negligible. In addition, higher birth order has a significant and large negative effect on children's education. We also study adult earnings, employment, and teenage childbearing and find strong evidence for birth order effects with these outcomes, particularly among women. These findings suggest the need to revisit economic models of fertility and child “production,” focusing not only on differences across families but differences within families as well.},

  abstract = {We propose strategies to estimate and make inference on key features of heterogeneous effects in randomized experiments. These key features include best linear predictors of the effects on machine learning proxies, average effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least impacted units. The approach is valid in high dimensional settings, where the effects are proxied by machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into the estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in conjunction with penalized methods, deep and shallowneural networks, canonical and newrandom forests, boosted trees, and ensemble methods. Estimation and inference are based on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve validity. For inference, we take medians of p-values and medians of confidence intervals, resulting from many different data splits, and then adjust their nominal level to guarantee uniform validity. This variational inference method, which quantifies the uncertainty coming from both parameter estimation and data splitting, is shown to be uniformly valid for a large class of data generating processes. We illustrate the use of the approach with a randomized field experiment that evaluated a combination of nudges to stimulate demand for immunization in India.},
